# The Penguin Project README

## Overview
This project started as extra practice using Seaborn. The original notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/HeatherOrtegaMcMillan/numpy-pandas-visualization-exercises/blob/main/extra_seaborn_practice.ipynb). 

As the exploration went on, and as I learned more in codeup, I decided to continue exploring and try to do some modeling with this dataset. 

### Why this data? 
I really like penguins üêß. Always have. 

### What am I doing?
Learning about the data science pipeline. This is a learning project. I am by no means perfect. And there is lots of practice and learning going on in this project. 

### Are there any goals?
Yes. They are as follows:
- Learn about vizualization 
- Utilize machine learning model to predict different species based on their measurements
- Practice documenting findings
